# module-description-tracking-form

Creating pre-populated tracking forms for the module review in academic year 2016/17 in the School of Computer Science & Informatics, Cardiff University


## Requirements

* jinja2  
    for HTML templating
* weasyprint
    for HTML -> PDF conversion

## Libs

Uses [skeleton.css](getskeleton.com), slightly modified to remove media queries (since weasyprint doesn't like them).
